The rules are strict (especially the one-second accuracy requirement for the computation of moon phases and solar terms) and there is no shortcut. Whether something is simple or not also depends on one's experience. For those who are familiar with astronomical computation, the calculation required by GB/T 33661-2017 document is not that difficult, although not simple.</p><p>Since the 7th century, the topics involved in calendrical astronomy in China were close to those covered in the modern astronomical almanac. Making calendar was just one funcion of calendrical astronomy. The calculations in calendrical astronomy were based on the most accurate observation data and most advanced theory available at the time. The calculations were also not simple relative to the calculation tools available at the time. So the requirements stated in the GB/T 33661-2017 document are in accord with the Chinese tradition of calendrical astronomy.</p><p>However, there are simple approximate formulae to calculate solar terms and moon phases. You can find them in <i>Astronomical Algorithms</i> by Jean Meeus. The book only provides formulae for the equinoxes and solstices, but it should not be difficult to generalize them to calculate the other solar terms. While the accuracy of those approximate formulae do not meet the requirement of GB/T 33661-2017, they can still be used to calculate the Chinese calendar. The error of the computed Chinese calendar dates may be ~0.1% or even less. One can first use those approximate formulae to calculate the Chinese calendar, compare the calculated dates with the official Chinese calendar promulgated by the Purple Mountain Observatory, and then correct the ~0.1% error. This could be an alternative method to do the Western-Chinese calendar conversion.</p></div><input type="checkbox" class="accordion" id="sexagenary_calculation"> <label class="accordion" for="sexagenary_calculation"><li>How do you calculate the sexagenary cycles?</li></label><div class="content"><p>This is explained in detail on the <a href="sexagenary.html">sexagenary cycle page</a>. The sexagenary cycle can be used to count years, months, days, and (double) hours. The sexagenary years, days and hours are easy to compute. The sexagenary month on a particular Gregorian date is more complicated to compute. However, sexagenary months were rarely used even in ancient official Chinese documents, and hours were simply indicated by the branch numbers only.</p></div></ol></div><br><br><script>header(0,"","faq")</script></body></html>
