<input type="checkbox" class="accordion" id="conversion_formula" />
<label class="accordion" for="conversion_formula"><li>Is there a simple formula to calculate the Chinese calendar?</li></label>

<div class="content">
<p>For the modern Chinese calendar, the short answer is no.</p>
<p>As explained on the <a href="rules.html">Chinese Calendar rule page</a>, modern Chinese calendar is calculated according to the GB/T 33661-2017 document. The rules are strict (especially the one-second accuracy requirement for the computation of moon phases and solar terms) and there is no shortcut. Whether something is simple or not also depends on one's experience. For those who are familiar with astronomical computation, the calculation required by GB/T 33661-2017 document is not that difficult, although not simple.</p>
<p>Since the 7th century, the topics involved in calendrical astronomy in China were close to those covered in the modern astronomical almanac. Making calendar was just one funcion of calendrical astronomy. The calculations in calendrical astronomy were based on the most accurate observation data and most advanced theory available at the time. The calculations were also not simple relative to the calculation tools available at the time. So the requirements stated in the GB/T 33661-2017 document are in accord with the Chinese tradition of calendrical astronomy.</p>
<p>However, there are simple approximate formulae to calculate solar terms and moon phases. You can find them in <i>Astronomical Algorithms</i> by Jean Meeus. The book only provides formulae for the equinoxes and solstices, but it should not be difficult to generalize them to calculate the other solar terms. While the accuracy of those approximate formulae do not meet the requirement of GB/T 33661-2017, they can still be used to calculate the Chinese calendar. The error of the computed Chinese calendar dates may be ~0.1% or even less. One can first use those approximate formulae to calculate the Chinese calendar, compare the calculated dates with the official Chinese calendar promulgated by the Purple Mountain Observatory, and then correct the ~0.1% error. This could be an alternative method to do the Western-Chinese calendar conversion.</p>

<label class="accordion" for="sexagenary_calculation"><li>How do you calculate the sexagenary cycles?</li></label>

<div class="content">
<p>This is explained in detail on the <a href="sexagenary.html">sexagenary cycle page</a>. The sexagenary cycle can be used to count years, months, days, and (double) hours. The sexagenary years, days and hours are easy to compute. The sexagenary month on a particular Gregorian date is more complicated to compute. However, sexagenary months were rarely used even in ancient official Chinese documents, and hours were simply indicated by the branch numbers only.</p>

<input type="checkbox" class="accordion" id="conjunction" />
<label class="accordion" for="conjunction"><li>Why were there discrepancies between the start of Chinese months and the times of new moons in the ancient time?</li></label>

<div class="content">
<p>The question refers to the occasional mismatches between the times of new moons indicated on the <a href="index.html">calendar page</a> and the start of Chinese months in the ancient time. For example, a new moon occurred at 19:54 on March 6 in 813, but the start date of the second Chinese month was on March 7, 813.</p>
<p>As explained on the <a href="rules.html">Chinese calendar rules page</a>, a new moon (conjunction) must fall on the first day of a Chinese month. This rule was established since ancient times. The mismatches are caused by at least the following three reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The times of moon phases listed on the calendar page are calculated using modern ephemerides and following modern definition. The calculation of moon phases in the ancient time could deviate significantly from modern calculation. For example, the conjunctions were calculated by taking into account only the mean motion of the Moon and Sun (mean conjunction) before the 7th century. Modern calculations also take into account the non-uniform motion of the Sun and Moon (true conjunction). The times of mean conjunctions can deviate from the true conjunctions by one day. It is also well-known that the conjunction times determined by calendars in the Qin and Early Han dynasties (221 BCE &ndash; 104 BCE) were later than the astronomical conjunction times. The average of the time differences was about one day (see the discussion <a href="QinHanCalendars.html#conjDiff">here</a>). This explains why the recorded solar eclipses in the early Han dynasty often occurred one day (and sometimes two days) before the calendrical conjunction days. True conjunctions were used in the calendar calculation since the mid 7th century. However, the calculated times were not very accurate.</p></li>

<li><p>The times of moon phases listed on the calendar page are the local mean time of 120&deg;E (UT+8). Here UT refers to UT1 (before 1972) or UTC (1972 and later). The ancient people didn't use mean solar time. Their times were based on the local apparent solar time. For example, the capital of China was at the present day Xi'an (longitude = 108.9&deg;E) in the Tang dynasty (618 &ndash; 907). The difference between the apparent solar time of Xi'an and UT+8 is 44 minutes + the equation of time.</p></li>

<li><p>The Chinese calendars between 665 and 1280 sometimes imposed the <i>jinshuo rule</i> (進朔法), which stipulated that the conjunction day would be moved to one day later if the conjunction time fell on later than ~18:00 (the exact time slightly depended on seasons) if no solar eclipse was visible on that day.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The discrepancy in the second Chinese month of 813 mentioned above was likely casued by the jinshuo rule. Since 1914, moon phases and solar terms have been computed using modern method. However, time was based on the mean solar time of the Beijing meridian (116°25' E), which has a time difference of about 14 minutes with respect to UT+8. For example, the new moon associated with the Chinese new year in 1916 occurred on February 4 at 00:05 (UT+8), but the Chinese new year was celebrated on February 3 because the new moon was on February 3 at 23:51 in Beijing's local mean time. The current China standard time (UT+8) was adopted in 1929.</p>
