The computation method is described in detail in <a href="docs/sunMoon.pdf">this pdf document</a>, but precession is calculated using the Vondr&#225;k et. al. precession model described in Section 7.2 of the document in order to cover long time span.</p><p>Times are given to the nearest minute. For example, 14:23 means the one-minute time interval [14:22:30, 14:23:30). However, 00:00 and 24:00 are special &mdash; 00:00 means the 30-second time interval [0:00:00, 0:00:30) and 24:00 means the 30-second time interval [23:59:30, 24:00:00). The one-minute accuracy of the times of moon phases and solar terms is of no astronomical significance. As explained in the <a href="rules.html">Chinese calendar rules</a> page, the official document GB/T 33661-2017 requires, in calendar calculation, computing lunar conjunctions and solar terms to an accuracy of about one second (not including the unpublished leap seconds) in order to handle the rare situation in which a conjunction or a solar term occurs very close to midnight.</p><p>Solar and lunar eclipses associated with the new moons and full moons are indicated with links to pages describing the eclipse circumstances. For more information about solar and lunar eclipses, visit my <a href="http://ytliu.epizy.com/eclipse/" target="_blank">Eight Millennia of Eclipses</a> website.</p><p>Dates are given in Gregorian calendar beginning on Oct. 15, 1582 and in Julian calendar before that day. The day after Oct 4, 1582 was Oct. 15, 1582. Dates before 8 CE. are given in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleptic_Julian_calendar" target="_blank">proleptic Julian calendar</a>.</p><p>You can enter the year using the URL query string "?y=[year]". For example, to show the year 1850, use the (relative) URL <a href="sunMoon.html?y=1850">sunMoon.html?y=1850</a>. This won't work if the y parameter in the query string is not a number or is outside the range [-3500, 3500].</p><br><br></div><noscript><h1>Phases of the Moon and 24 Solar Terms</h1><h2>Oops!</h2><p>You must enable JavaScript to use this page.</p><p>Please enable JavaScript and reload.</p></noscript><script>init(0)</script></body></html>
